Testimonials

“I like the initiative. I'm not vegetarian but I'd be fine with vegetarian-only meals at work all week -- I think all of us could get by without meat for three meals a week. :)”
“Do it more frequently; once a month isn't a enough. (Also, as a vegetarian, I'd like to remind everyone that I rarely have a reasonable on-site lunch option, and thus feel little sympathy for the carnivores among us who might be inconvenienced by Meatless Mondays.)”
“I'm a meat-eater, but I think having all-veg one day per week is great. Not specifically to do with MM, but I was wondering if we could also try having just 1 meat item instead of two on the other days, substituting with a meat alternative, for another 50% reduction? Or is that asking for rebellion?!”
