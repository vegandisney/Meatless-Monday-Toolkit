## Catering Ask

Hi [Merchant Name],

[Your Business Name] recently started doing a Meatless Monday on the first Monday of each month at the office in lieu of the traditional catering we normally do and have been featuring local restaurants.  

After looking at your catering menu it looks like there are a few vegetarian and vegan options at [Merchant Name] and I was wondering if you'd be open to being on our list of merchants we turn to when planning our once a month events, and potentially publishing you as a Meatless Monday Friendly caterer when we chat with other businesses interested in trying out Meatless Monday for the environment.

No rush on an answer since we're booked until end of year for our services, but we've loved working with you in the past and wanted to include you as a recommendation to other businesses if you're open to it!

Let me know if you have any questions.  Have a great day!
