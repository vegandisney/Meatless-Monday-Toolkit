# Meatless Monday Toolkit
Everything you need to start hosting Meatless Monday at your company.

We have created a Meatless Monday Toolkit with data, posters and table stand collateral, testimonials, survey questions, a list of Meatless Monday friendly caterers, engagement statistics from Postmates own Meatless Monday, and a roll out template so that companies we challenge to try Meatless Monday have everything they need to try it too as a way to raise awareness around climate change and the environmental impact people can have individually and as a group.

We will amplify the positive environmental impact of reduced meat consumption by making it easy for other companies to run internal Meatless Mondays campaigns.  We will generate buzz with a public challenge to our competitors to see who can reduce the meat consumption of their employees the most.  We will do a press release to CSR and sustainability themed outlets, as well as publishing information and participating statistics on our Blog.
