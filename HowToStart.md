# Roll Out Template:

* Step 1: Decide you want to host a Meatless Monday at your office and get sign off from all key stakeholders.  Think Office Manager, CEO, the person who loves meat the most in your office.  Tell them the benefits of going Meatless on Monday to showcase the reasons why this is a good place to start the conversation about their impact on the environment.
* Step 2: Pick a date.  
* Step 3: Book a caterer from our list or ask your caterer if they can prepare an awesome meat-free meal.  We host ours the first Monday of each month so that itâ€™s not too much of a burden on the team or on one caterer.
* Step 4: Share with the team in advance that you will be hosting a Meatless Monday, why, and invite them to share in updating the Impact Model.
* Step 5: Print posters and table collateral as necessary for day of material.  Try to find a few people who are really excited about this project and try to have them be overtly positive about the experience.
* Step 6: Start a channel where people can provide feedback.  Maybe #meatless-monday in Slack, or a Google Form survey.
* Step 7: Read all of the feedback, iterate based on the feedback, and plan for your next one!
